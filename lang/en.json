In order to support localization, you need to replace them with regular expressions that would match the lore name in your language. These will be converted with `SearchFilter.cleanQuery` function. These are not slugs. You don't have to add '-lore' to the end. If you are unsure of how to write a regular expression, part of the lore name that is common between all the name variants will work, or just list all the name variants you can think of separated by '|' (vertical bar/pipe operator).\nWith kind regards,\nA fellow translator",
